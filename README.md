# back at it

Me brushing up on my p5.js skills, quite literally.  
To view the script running go to the ghpages link below:

This script cycles through a sequence of images at random intervals, giving a jittery, caffeinated appearance to what would otherwise be a normal gif. Could add the ability to randomize the order of the images, which would (potentially) make the whole image even more discombobulating.
